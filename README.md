# Chroni-heart-disease-prediction
Improving Risk Identification in Chronic Heart Failure and Machine Learning Techniques
Developed a web-based heart risk assessment system using machine learning and data mining techniques. Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection and trained multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression) to evaluate predictive performance. Achieved highest accuracy with XGBoost and integrated the best-performing model into a user-friendly Flask web application that takes 13 health inputs and predicts heart disease risk in real time.
Used RFE to select top 10 features from 13 for efficient model training.

Implemented StandardScaler for normalization and stratified data splitting.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

Designed and deployed a web interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

Achieved real-time predictions with XGBoost model, providing clear health risk feedback to users.
